## Joy A Burke Portfolio Webiste

This is what it sounds like. A collection of my skills and work which potential employeers and co-workers can view. 

## My Contributions

I built this site using HTML, CSS, and a small amount of JavaScript. I wanted something simple and easy to put together that was easily editable and this was the end result. The grid at the bottom with short little videos was the only challenging part. Thankfully the developer community is gracious and I received some thoughtful suggestions which resolved my issue. It of course was obvious hindesight wise, but that's the beauty of learning! 

## What I learned

- It's okay to look stupid - everyone has been there
- You can do a lot with a little HTML and CSS
- How to upload a webpage created from scratch to a subdomain on my own website
